# SMS-Email App
The sms-email app is a simple application that does the sending of both emails and sms.

It runs on
* Rails 7.1.1
* Ruby 3.1.2

To test the sms functionaly, ensure that you have both account_sid and auth_token properly set up. Read more on Twilio Documentation [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api/message-resource).
There are two ways in which the sms is sent:
1. Sent immediately
2. Scheduled at a later date

The Sample API endpoints are found [here](http://bit.ly/3MxDCfF).
